# webpack-es6-boilerplate

This is my first Webpack boilerplate that I wrote as a 
practice.

This is a work in progress.

## How to build
After cloning this repo, run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

A `dist` folder will be generated. To view the page in the 
browser, simply open `index.html` file. Alternatively, you
may also type `npm run serve` to start `webpack-dev-server`
and view the page in browser by typing `http://localhost:8080`.
